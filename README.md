# Memotest Game

## Description

Another classic. The Memotest game recreated with code! Click around the board and try to match the colors that highlight. But beware! If you choose the wrong combination the colors will hide and you will have to remember where the correct one was!

### Technologies Used

For this project the technologies and tools used were:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- SASS
- HTML
- NPM
- Cypress

#

## Installation

As this project runs with Bootstrap and Cypress you will have to have NPM or anything similar and then run this little code snippet on the CLI.

```
npm install
```

This will allow to download the dependencies you need to run the Memotest properly.

#

## Utilization

The game works as the original one. A game board is presented with empty boxes. Once the user presses one box, it will highlight with its color and it will remain selected.

Then, if the user has the possibility of choosing another box. If the color of the box matches the previously selected, it will become gray and it will be removed from the game. If the color should not match the original one, both of the color boxes will return to their original base color.

Once all the colors are matched throughout the board. A victory message will appear displaying how many rounds the user took to finish the game and a button that allows the user to restart the game if wished.

## Challenges Faced

This project brought fresh challenges to overcome like:

- Learning how to use Cypress to create integration tests.

- Searching for different array methods for specific situations

  - Randomizing the colors each the game is started.

  - Assign each box a specific color.

#

## What I learned

- Cypress integration tests. It was really nice to see how integration tests work. They are really useful to confirm that your code is optimal and ready for deployment.

- Arrays have an amazing quantity of methods that we can use to modify them.

- jQuery, Mocha and Chai frameworks. They all come integrated with Cypress, so learning them while writing integration tests was a plus!
