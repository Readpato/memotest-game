# Memotest Game

To start properly building the game, we need a layout where all the Memotest game is going to appear.

We are going to have a title, and beneath it we are going to have a grid layout with 12 colors divided into
4 rows with 3 colors each. We are going to use Bootstrap to build the layout and then style it with SASS or Bootstrap classes.
